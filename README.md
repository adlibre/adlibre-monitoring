# Adlibre Monitoring

Here we have our collection of client monitoring scripts and configurations for [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org) and [Icinga](http://www.icinga.org/).
We've also included a [fabric](http://fabfile.org) deployment script to make installation easy.

## Setup

Check this out onto a host or virtualenv containing fabric.

## Install

1. Using _fabric_, deploy the configurations to your hosts.

2. Run ``fab --list`` to show all available commands.

3. Configure Nagios / Icinga. We've left this part up to you.

## License

Unless otherwise noted all scripts here are covered by BSD 3 Clause.
